#+TITLE: Tutorial Notes

* Problems

- start with something that doesn't require maps; say, a small
  fixed universe of hosts. This isn't going to use incremental in
  an especially interesting way, but it's a good place to start.

- Maybe even have an open universe of hosts, but have part of the
  query be to select which hosts you actually look at. That's
  static enough to avoid maps. You'll need an imperatively managed
  table of data on the outside, though.

- Various queries to push the model more, in particular:

- find set of checks of a certain kind that failed (filter_map)

- find set of stale nodes (clock + filter_map')

- Rank queries? (nth-worst host?, median host?)

- Merging examples? Drop rates on hosts with most highly loaded
  switches?

* Other Thoughts

- Benchmarks! Make sure that we have all-at-once computations for each
  of these.

* Next Steps

- Talk to Dlo and Perl about useful queries to implement.
