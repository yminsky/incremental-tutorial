Let's start with something very simple. Take a look at *simple.ml*. It
should be straightforward to follow this function and you can run its
executable by using "build.sh" at the top-level.

The goal of this exercise is to finish the implementation of
*incr.ml*, an incrementalized version of this program that behaves in
exactly the same way, i.e. its output is unchanged. But we want to use
incremental to represent the computation.
