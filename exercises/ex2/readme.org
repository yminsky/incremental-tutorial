Now it's time look at a more real-world example!

For the rest of this tutorial we are going to work on an application
that monitors the state and the health of a collection of machines,
e.g. all boxes in a datacenter.

# CR sfunk: Explain more about the setup

As a first simple query, we would like to keep track of the following information:

1. total number of checks that succeeded / total number of checks run

(This is across all hosts.) 

Of course, this is such a simple query, that Incremental doesn't give
us much. But it'll teach us the necessary steps for more interesting
queries.

For a non-incremental implementation of it, take a look at
shared/client.ml:Number_of_failed_checks. You can run this with:

./_build/solutions/main.exe client -port PORT -which-query number-of-failed-checks

Again the goal of this exercise is to write a version of this query
that uses Incremental.
