Let's add a check that prints out all checks we consider 'stale', we
have not seen an update for this (check,host) in the last Xs.

To do this, we have to keep track of the last time we've seen an
update for each (check,host) and whether that time is stale. We want
to update this whenever we get a new [Event.t] from the server and
register a time in the future to wake up to consider if the check is
now stale.

Take a look at shared/client.ml:Staleness for a non-incremental
version. Note, the non-incremental version just recomputes what things
are stale right before updating the output. Try using Incremental's
[S_with_abstract_times] to calculate this more precisely.
